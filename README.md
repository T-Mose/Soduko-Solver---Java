Soduko Solver written in java by me T3D. An extension of my previous project of this solver written in c#. This program can solve every single soduko puzzle. Can be run either by changing the in-code puzzle string or by feeding the soduko string as input when running the program. It implements regular solving techniques such as singe values, naked pairs, hidden pairs, point pairs, hidden triples. It does not implement XYZ-wings or Swordfish strategies. It keeps track of where no progress is made and at that stage starts to "guess" an optimal value and then a backtracking brute force algorithm is done to solve the puzzle. This is less efficient than the regular techniques though not that inefficient, since after each guess, it goes back to the regular techniques and continues solving potentially guessing again if its required. There is then a check for a solutionâ€™s validity with the potential to backtrack to another guess.
Ways to make the program more efficient: Add a check to checkPossible which updates each cells potential values. This is only required where the solving techniques have reduced the potential values. Additionally, this does not need to be checked for the entire puzzle. If 0.0 is changed, ideally only Row 0, Column 0 and square 1,1 should need to be checked.
