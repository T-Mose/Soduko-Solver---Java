Soduko Solver written in java by me T3D. An extension of my prevoius project of this solver written in c#. This program is able to solve every singel soduko puzzle. Can be run either by changing the in-code puzzle string or by feeding the soduko string as input when running the program. It implements regular solving techniques such as singe values, naked pairs, hidden pairs, point pairs, hidden tripples. It does not implement XYZ-wings or Swordfish strategies. It keeps track of where no progress is made and at that stage starts to "guess" a optimal value and then a backtracking bruteforce algoritm is done to solve the puzzle. This is less efficient then the regular techniques though not that inefficient, since after each guess, it goes back to the regular techniques and continues solving potentially guessing again if its required. There is then a check for a solutions validity with the potential to backtrack to another guess.

Ways to make the program more efficient:
Add a check to checkPossible which updates each cells potential values. This is only required where the solving techniques have reduced the potential values. Additionally does this not need to be checked for the entire puzzle. If 0.0 is changed, ideelly only Row 0, Column 0 and square 1,1 should need to be checked.
